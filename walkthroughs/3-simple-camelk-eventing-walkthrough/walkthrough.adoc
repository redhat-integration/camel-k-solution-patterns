We live in an era when business events are everywhere. Apache Camel K integrations and event-driven services to help tie some of those events together. 

In this Solution Pattern, you will be helping with a virtual fruit stand and creating a simple Camel K integration that pulls fruit from an online source of fruit-related nutritional information.

== The Fruit Vendor

The Fruit Vendor offers a stall in the market and a veritable wonderland of options for shoppers in need of produce. 

The manager of the site has asked you to start to pull together information on their produce to help inform the buyer of nutritional details. Details such as:

* Calories
* Carbohydrates
* Fats
* Protein
* Sugar

=== The Solution

In this solution pattern, we will use the Fruityvice API service which is an Open API that provides nutritional data for all kinds of fruit. We can use this service to retrieve JSON-formatted data which will be used in the solution pattern. 

Fruityvice enables you to use a GET call and retrieve JSON around common fruits. For example, a GET about data for `Banana` (link:https://fruityvice.com/api/fruit/banana[GET api/fruit/banana, window="_blank"]) returns:

[source,json]
....
{
    "genus": "Musa",
    "name": "Banana",
    "id": 1,
    "family": "Musaceae",
    "order": "Zingiberales",
    "nutritions": {
        "carbohydrates": 22,
        "protein": 1,
        "fat": 0.2,
        "calories": 96,
        "sugar": 17.2
    }
}
....

{bl}
We will use The Fruit Vendor's Red Hat Integration (RHI) system which is already in place, create an event using Red Hat AMQ, and create a new Camel K route which performs the call to the Fruityvice API, processes the returned JSON data, and adds a streamlined event to be used downstream.

[id='creating-a-project']
== Creating a Project
:task-context: creating-a-project

This demonstration requires a single project with event streaming and Camel K resources. In this step we will create a project named `fruit-stand`.

****
*Creating new projects in OpenShift*
****

If you have logged in as a cluster administrator, follow these steps to create a new eventing project:

. Navigate to *Home* -> *Projects*. (link:{openshift-projects-url}[OpenShift Console->Projects, window="_blank"])
. Click *Create Project*.
. In the *Create Project* dialog box, enter `fruit-stand`, in the *Name* field.
. Optional: Add the *Display Name* and *Description* details for the project.
. Click *Create*.
. Monitor the OpenShift Console until a green check mark is displayed next to the new project.

{bl}
If you have logged in as a developer, follow these steps to create a new eventing project:

. Navigate to *+Add* (link:{openshift-add-url}[OpenShift Console->Developer->+Add, window="_blank"]).
. Select the *Project* drop-down at the top and click *Create Project*.
. Enter a project named `fruit-stand` and click *Create*.

[type=verification]

* If you have logged in as a cluster administrator, go to link:{openshift-projects-url}[OpenShift Console->Projects, window="_blank"] in the console. Do you see your newly created project displayed in the *Projects* list?
* If you have logged in as a developer, go to link:{openshift-add-url}[OpenShift Console->Developer->+Add, window="_blank"] in the console. Do you see your newly created project displayed in the *Project* drop-down list?

[id='installing-operators']
== Installing Operators
:task-context: installing-operators

NOTE: Normally this step would be done ahead of the time by the cluster administrator and requires administrator access.

With the project created, we can now install each of the following operators which we will need for each namespace:

* Red Hat Integration - Camel K Operator
* Red Hat Integration - AMQ Streams Operator

// These links should work, but it opens into an error state - do we have a better link to point to for these operators?
//* link:{https://catalog.redhat.com/software/operators/detail/5ef256e84a5747832973cc6b}[Red Hat Integration - Camel K Operator, window="_blank"]
//* link:{https://catalog.redhat.com/software/operators/detail/5ef20efd46bc301a95a1e9a4}[Red Hat Integration - AMQ Streams Operator, window="_blank"]

{bl}
Follow these steps to install the Camel K operator.

. Go to *Operators > OperatorHub* in the link:{openshift-host}/operatorHub[OpenShift Console, window="_blank"].
. Make sure `fruit-stand` is selected as the project in the *Project* dropdown.
. In the *Filter by keyword* text box, enter `Camel K` to find the *Red Hat Integration - Camel K Operator*.
. Read the information about the Operator, and click *Install*. 
. On the *Create Operator Subscription* page, select the following subscription setting: ** *Installation Mode > A specific namespace on the cluster > fruit-stand*
. Click *Subscribe* to make the Operator available to the selected namespace, the upgrade status should resolve to *Up to date* without intervention.
. After the upgrade status of the Subscription is *Up to date*, select *Operators â†’ Installed Operators*. The Camel K Operator *Status* should ultimately resolve to *InstallSucceeded* in the relevant namespace.

{bl}
Repeat the process to install the *Red Hat Integration - AMQ Streams Operator* into the `fruit-stand` namespace.

[type=verification]
Go to the link:{openshift-installed-operators-url}[OpenShift Console->Operators->Installed Operators, window="_blank"]. Do you see your newly installed operators displayed in the *Installed Operators* list on the namespaces you selected?

[id='creating-kafka-instance']
== Create a Kafka Instance
:task-context: creating-kafka-instance

With the projects created and operators installed, we can start setting up our event flow. We need to create a Kafka instance to get us started.

****
*Creating a Kafka Instance*
****

Follow these steps to create a new Kafka instance.

. Go to the link:{openshift-add-kafka-url}[OpenShift Console->+Add->From Catalog (Filter by keyword = kafka), window="_blank"].
. Make sure `fruit-stand` is selected as the project in the Project dropdown.
. Locate and click *Kafka*, then click *Create*.
. Click *Edit Form* to view the options, but leave all settings to their defaults.
. Click *Create*.

{bl}
Monitor the link:{openshift-topology-url}[Developer->Topology, window="_blank"] page until the new Kafka cluster appears.

[type=verification]
. Go to the link:{openshift-topology-url}[Developer->Topology, window="_blank"].
. Make sure `fruit-stand` is selected as the project in the Project dropdown.
. Verify that `my-cluster-kafka` and `my-cluster-zookeeper` appear in the `amqstreams` group.

[id='creating-kafka-topic']
== Create a Kafka Topic
:task-context: creating-kafka-topic

Next we will set up a Kafka topic listening to events (fruits).

****
*Creating a Kafka Topic*
****

Follow these steps to create a new Kafka topic.

. Go to the link:{openshift-add-kafka-url}[OpenShift Console->+Add->From Catalog (Filter by keyword = kafka), window="_blank"].
. Make sure `fruit-stand` is selected as the project in the Project dropdown.
. Locate and click *Kafka Topic*, then click *Create*.
. Click *Edit Form* to peruse the options in a user-friendly format.
. Change the Name from `my-topic` to `fruits`. 
. Click *Create*.

[type=verification]
. Go to the link:{openshift-search-kafka-topic-url}[Developer->More->Search (Resources filter = KafkaTopic), window="_blank"].
