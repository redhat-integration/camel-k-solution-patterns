We live in an era when business events are everywhere. Apache Camel K integrations and event-driven services to help tie some of those events together. 

In this Solution Pattern, you will be helping with a virtual fruit stand and creating a simple Camel K integration that pulls fruit from an online source of fruit-related nutritional information.

== The Fruit Vendor

The Fruit Vendor offers a stall in the market and a veritable wonderland of options for shoppers in need of produce. 

The manager of the site has asked you to start to pull together information on their produce to help inform the buyer of nutritional details. Details such as:

* Calories
* Carbohydrates
* Fats
* Protein
* Sugar

=== The Solution

In this solution pattern, we will use the Fruityvice API service which is an Open API that provides nutritional data for all kinds of fruit. We can use this service to retrieve JSON-formatted data which will be used in the solution pattern. 

Fruityvice enables you to use a GET call and retrieve JSON around common fruits. For example, a GET about data for `Banana` (link:https://fruityvice.com/api/fruit/banana[GET api/fruit/banana, window="_blank"]) returns:

[source,json]
....
{
    "genus": "Musa",
    "name": "Banana",
    "id": 1,
    "family": "Musaceae",
    "order": "Zingiberales",
    "nutritions": {
        "carbohydrates": 22,
        "protein": 1,
        "fat": 0.2,
        "calories": 96,
        "sugar": 17.2
    }
}
....

{bl}
We will use The Fruit Vendor's Red Hat Integration (RHI) system which is already in place, create an event using Red Hat AMQ, and create a new Camel K route which performs the call to the Fruityvice API, processes the returned JSON data, and adds a streamlined event to be used downstream.

== Getting Started
:task-context: getting-started

This demonstration assumes that the RHI Operator has been installed previously, which sets up the AMQ Streams, Camel K, Service Registry, and Solution Explorer operators in unique namespaces. We are interested in two of those namespaces for this demo.

* redhat-rhmi-amq-streams (with the AMQ Streams operator pre-installed)
* redhat-rhmi-camel-k (with the Camel K perator pre-installed)

{bl}

In the following steps, we will set up a new Kafka Topic (fruits) and two Camel K integrations (fruits-producer and put-to-topic). The first integration provides our connection to the FruityVice API and will conduct an http GET for the nutritional information we're looking for, based on an input provided by our second integration. When the fruit information is retrieved, it will be put on the Kafka Topic `fruits`.

Make sure you are in `Developer` role in the {openshift-console-url}[OpenShift Console, window="_blank"].

Go to link:{openshift-add-url}[OpenShift Console->Developer->+Add, window="_blank"] in the console. Do you see the two projects (`redhat-rhmi-amq-streams` and `redhat-rhmi-camel-k`) displayed in the *Project* drop-down list?
